      "summary": "In October 2024, I had the chance to present MASRETT (Malaysian Sign Language Real-Time Tutorial) at the Pre-NALI 2024 workshops, hosted by Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM). The event, aimed at exploring innovative ways to integrate research into teaching, provided a platform for educators, researchers, and technology enthusiasts to share ideas and insights. It was an exciting opportunity for our team to showcase a demo of MASRETT, a project we’ve been working on to make learning Malaysian Sign Language (MSL) more accessible and interactive for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community in Malaysia.",

The platform includes features like progress tracking, quizzes, and a sandbox mode where learners can practice at their own pace. While the project is still in its early stages, our demo highlighted what’s to come: a powerful tool for MSL learning that integrates AI and real-time technology. The primary focus of our demo was the real-time model implementation, which tracks user progress and gives feedback as they practice.",

Our responsibilities included developing the web platform using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and implementing the real-time sign language detection model. The integration of this AI-powered model was one of the most exciting parts of the project, as it allowed us to give users immediate feedback on their sign language skills. Although the real-time detection system isn’t fully complete, the demo provided a glimpse into the potential of what we’re building.",

Buyers bid on the listings to compete for prices. Buyers place competitive bids on the agricultural waste listings that match their requirements. This would allow them to access these resources at lower prices, fostering an efficient and cost-effective marketplace."

I then analyzed maintenance patterns and identified key metrics like the average number of maintenance entries per bus and the percentage of buses waiting for spare parts. I used the Naive Bayes model for the predictive model, as it was well-suited for the small dataset and the categorization of engine health into discrete labels. After preparing the data, I trained the model to forecast potential engine health issues based on historical data. This predictive model forms the core of MaintainIQ, enabling proactive maintenance decisions.",

I then created a CSV file with unique VEH_IDs for MRT feeder buses and filtered the engine repair data to match. Next, I analyzed the data to calculate the average number of maintenance entries per bus (8 times per month) and discovered that 25.3% of buses were waiting for spare parts. I also calculated the time difference between normal maintenance and buses waiting for parts, which averaged 12 days. With the data prepared, I applied a Naive Bayes model to predict engine health based on this historical data.",
