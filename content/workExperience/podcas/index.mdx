Podcas streamlines podcast creation using AI to transform ideas into complete episodes within minutes.

- **Architected and developed** the web app (Next.js, Drizzle ORM, PostgreSQL, tRPC, Better Auth, ShadCN UI) and mobile app (React Native, Expo, NativeWind, Better Auth) for iOS and Android.
- Led the migration from a legacy Next.js + Supabase stack to a **modern PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM architecture**, improving scalability, reliability, and cross-platform consistency.
- Built end-to-end AI podcast generation pipelines, including multi-step episode creation, **LLM-driven script generation**, multi-provider TTS/audio processing, and automated audio tasks using Trigger.dev for queueing, retries, and long-running job management.
- Designed and implemented core features such as authentication, profile management, podcast discovery/search, playback (mini and expanded players), category-based organization, and deep-link sharing.
- Implemented shared validation, **reusable components**, and cross-platform UI/UX improvements based on Figma designs, enhancing consistency, accessibility, and user experience.
- Collaborated with product and design teams to deliver a **cohesive, user-focused experience** across web and mobile platforms.
