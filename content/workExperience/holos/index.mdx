##### [HOLOS-IE / HOLOS-EU](https://www.ucd.ie/holos-ie/)

HOLOS-IE and HOLOS-EU are data-driven, AI-assisted modeling platforms that support sustainable land-use planning, carbon accounting, and climate-smart agriculture across Ireland and Europe.

- Developed and maintained core application modules using **C#**, **Avalonia UI**, and **Telerik UI** for precision agriculture workflows.
- Implemented **Agroforestry** and **Dairy Cattle Economics** modules with cost–revenue modeling across management periods.
- Documented **IPCC Tier 2–based emission factor algorithms** for **Soil Organic Carbon (SOC)** and **nitrogen pools**, including initialization, decay rate, and steady-state modeling.
- Conducted **research, data engineering, and workflow documentation** for large-scale environmental and agricultural datasets.
- Contributed to the **HOLOS-EU modernization initiative**, developing a **cross-platform demo** with **Electron, React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, FastAPI**, and **AI-assisted analytics** to enhance usability, scalability, and decision-support performance.
