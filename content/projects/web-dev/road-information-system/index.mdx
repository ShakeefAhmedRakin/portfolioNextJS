excerpt: A road infrastructure management system for BP Kawasan Karimun. Manages road inventory, pavement condition assessment, and Treatment Trigger Index (TTI) calculations based on PKRMS Manual (SE 22/2022). Features role-based access, automated TTI computation, PDF report generation, and internationalization (EN/ID).

## Overview

A road infrastructure management system for BP Kawasan Karimun. Manages road inventory, pavement condition assessment, and Treatment Trigger Index (TTI) calculations based on Indonesia's PKRMS Manual (SE 22/2022). Built as a Turborepo monorepo with type-safe APIs (oRPC), session-based auth (Better Auth), and serverless PostgreSQL (Neon).

## Key Features

- **Road & Segment Management** — Create roads with auto-generated segments (configurable interval and generation mode). Track pavement inventory, shoulders, drainage, and land use per segment.
- **Pavement Damage Assessment** — Detailed damage forms for 5 pavement types (asphalt, concrete, block, gravel, unpaved) with type-specific parameters.
- **TTI Calculation** — Automated Treatment Trigger Index computation with condition ratings (Good/Fair/Poor/Bad) at segment and road level.
- **PDF Reports** — Client-side report generation with road condition summaries, segment analysis, and pavement statistics.
- **Role-Based Access** — Three roles: Admin (user management), Operator (road data entry & reporting), Visitor (view published reports). No public sign-ups.
- **User Management** — Ban/unban users, revoke sessions, manage passwords, assign roles.
- **Internationalization** — English and Indonesian language support.
- **Dark/Light Theme** — System preference detection with manual toggle.

## Dashboard & Road Overview

The dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of all roads with key metrics including total length, section width, and surface type percentages (Asphalt, Concrete, Block, Gravel, Unpaved).

## Road Management

Administrators and operators can manage the full lifecycle of road data, including creating, updating, and deleting roads. Each road supports auto-segment generation based on configurable intervals and generation modes.

## Segment & Pavement Assessment

Each road is divided into segments. Operators perform detailed pavement condition assessments across 5 pavement types, each with type-specific damage parameters (e.g., asphalt: bleeding, disintegration, crack analysis, potholes, rutting, edge damage).

## TTI Calculation & Reporting

TTI is automatically calculated based on weighted distress areas per segment. Roads are classified: Good (TTI < 25), Fair (25–50), Poor (50–75), Bad (TTI ≥ 75). PDF reports are generated client-side with road info, segment analysis, and condition statistics.

## User Management

Admins can create accounts, assign roles (Admin/Operator/Visitor), ban/unban users, revoke sessions, and manage passwords. Authentication via Better Auth with session-based security.

## Production Deployment

Deployed on **Vercel** (frontend + API) with **Neon** (serverless PostgreSQL). GitHub Actions handles migration checks on PRs and auto-runs migrations on merge to `main`.
