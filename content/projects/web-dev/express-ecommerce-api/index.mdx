## Overview

This is a backend RESTful API for an e-commerce platform, developed as an assignment for the **Programming Hero Level 2 Web Development Course**. The project focuses on building a robust Express server with TypeScript, integrating MongoDB via Mongoose for data persistence, and enforcing data integrity through Joi validation. It follows a clean modular architecture with separated concerns across routes, controllers, services, and models.

## Product Management

The API provides full CRUD operations for products. Each product includes a name, description, price, category, tags, variants (e.g., color, storage capacity), and inventory tracking. Products can be searched by a search term, retrieved individually by ID, updated, or deleted. The Mongoose schema enforces required fields with custom validation messages.

Key endpoints:

- `POST /api/products` — Create a new product
- `GET /api/products` — Retrieve all products (supports `?searchTerm=` query)
- `GET /api/products/:productId` — Retrieve a specific product
- `PUT /api/products/:productId` — Update a product
- `DELETE /api/products/:productId` — Delete a product

## Order Management & Inventory Control

The order system handles order creation and retrieval, with built-in inventory management logic. When an order is placed, the system checks available quantity in the inventory, returns an error if the ordered quantity exceeds stock, and automatically updates the inventory count and `inStock` status. Orders can be filtered by user email.

Key endpoints:

- `POST /api/orders` — Create a new order (with inventory validation)
- `GET /api/orders` — Retrieve all orders (supports `?email=` query)

## Architecture

The codebase follows a modular structure organized by domain:

- **Modules** — Separated into `product` and `order` modules, each with its own interface, model, controller, service, route, and validation layers
- **Validation** — Joi schemas validate incoming request data before processing
- **Error Handling** — Custom error responses for scenarios like product not found, insufficient inventory, and invalid routes
- **Configuration** — Environment variables managed via dotenv for database connection and port configuration
