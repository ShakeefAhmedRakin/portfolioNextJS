**Code:** [GitHub](https://github.com/ShakeefAhmedRakin/electron-react-ts-tailwind-shadcn-fastapi-template)

## Overview

This template provides a robust foundation for building modern cross-platform desktop applications. It leverages Electron.js for native desktop capabilities, React with TypeScript for a scalable frontend architecture, TailwindCSS and shadcn/ui for rapid, accessible UI development, and a FastAPI backend bundled with PyInstaller for efficient backend service deployment. Built with Vite, it offers fast development and production builds, tested on both Windows and macOS.

## Frontend Customization

- Uses Vite + React + TypeScript — behaves like a standard Vite React project.
- Easily install or remove npm packages as needed.
- Replace or extend shadcn/ui components or swap it for any other UI library (e.g., MUI, Chakra UI).
- Customize Tailwind config, themes, aliases, and project structure freely.
- Full flexibility to build a UI tailored to your needs while retaining Electron integration benefits.

## Backend Customization

- FastAPI backend bundled with PyInstaller for stable production builds.
- Add endpoints or scale architecture by refactoring into routers and services.
- Install any Python packages via requirements.txt as needed.
- Supports deep FastAPI structuring with multiple modules, routers, service, and database layers.
- Backend usage and import handling optimized for PyInstaller bundling.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ShakeefAhmedRakin/electron-react-ts-tailwind-shadcn-fastapi-template.git
   cd electron-react-ts-tailwind-shadcn-fastapi-template
   ```

2. Install frontend dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up the Python backend:

   - Create and activate a virtual environment (Python 3.8+ required).
   - Install dependencies:

     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

4. Development mode:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Starts FastAPI backend and Electron app with React hot reload.

5. Production build:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   Produces platform-specific build under `release/{version}` (Windows executable or macOS app bundle).

## Tech Stack
