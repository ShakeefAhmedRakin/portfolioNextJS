From crafting standout portfolios and profiles to practicing with mock interviews and receiving feedback on coding interviews, the journey was rigorous and rewarding. Going above and beyond on assignments, I achieved the required 85%+ benchmarks, performed strongly in final assessments, and earned the Black Belt for outstanding performance—proof of my dedication.
