## About the Course

The **Level 2 Web Development Course**—also known as “Next Level”—from Programming Hero builds upon foundational MERN skills and dives into advanced technologies like **TypeScript, Next.js, Redux, Express, PostgreSQL, Prisma, Docker, AWS, GraphQL, Vitest, and Jest**. The program includes over 1000 video lessons, ten or more hands‑on assignments, and two industry‑standard projects along with daily live support sessions, all designed to guide learners toward real‑world application development. Students are strongly recommended to spend around 4–5 hours per module or 20 hours weekly to succeed, with flexible pacing to accommodate working professionals .

## Personal Experience

I engaged deeply with the entire course content and completed each module thoroughly but unfortunately could not finish the final projects within the scheduled timeline due to overlapping life responsibilities. Ultimately, I didn't receive any certification but nonetheless the exposure to advanced backend and frontend tools significantly improved my technical competency and understanding. The mentorship and community support were invaluable and I emerged with a stronger ability to integrate technologies like TypeScript, Docker, GraphQL, and AWS into complex applications.

## What I Learned

- **Advanced Technical Skills**: Hands‑on practice with TypeScript, Express backends, PostgreSQL via Prisma, Redux state management, Next.js application structure, and testing frameworks like Vitest and Jest.
- **DevOps Exposure**: Gained practical familiarity with Docker containerization and AWS deployment basics.
- **Project Confidence**: Improved ability to architect full‑stack apps featuring proper DB modeling, API design, state management, and testing strategies.
- **Time Management Appreciation**: Balancing course demands and personal commitments taught me practical prioritization and workflow adaptability.

I am proud of the progress I made and remain motivated to complete the remaining projects at a steady pace. Deepest thanks to **Programming Hero** and the dedicated Level 2 mentors and community for their ongoing support.
