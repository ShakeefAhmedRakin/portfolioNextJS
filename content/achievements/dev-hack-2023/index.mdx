## The Idea and Teamwork

The idea for BillsGo stemmed from the challenges faced by utility users and companies in managing bills and collections. Adnan and I brainstormed the project idea, refining it through discussions to address real-world problems effectively. Meanwhile, Shimon and Dipto focused on developing the demo app, ensuring it was ready to showcase to the judges. I prepared the slides to clearly present our concept, tying together the technical and business aspects of the project.
