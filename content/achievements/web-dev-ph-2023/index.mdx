## About the Course

The Complete Web Development Course by Programming Hero is an intensive, project-based bootcamp focused on the MERN stack—MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js—along with Tailwind CSS, JavaScript (ES6+), Redux, and Next.js. Designed for serious learners, it spans multiple weekly modules with hands-on assignments, 2 large-scale projects, and daily live support sessions. Students benefit from 24/7 help, mentorship from experienced full-stack developers, and performance-based access to premium job placement tracks like Early Job Placement and SCIC. The course emphasizes practical skills, teamwork, and real-world readiness for full-stack development careers.

## Personal Experience

This program tested my persistence and passion. Juggling intensive modules, team projects, and rigorous assignments with real-time feedback shaped me into a more confident and disciplined developer. The supportive community and expert mentors—especially guidance from Jhankar Mahbub and the job placement team—were instrumental. Finishing on-time and scoring high unlocked my spot in the SCIC and Early Job Placement tracks.

## What I Learned

- **Technical Growth**: Gained deep hands-on experience with Tailwind, React hooks, async JavaScript, Node/Express backends, and MongoDB/Mongoose.
- **Project Management**: Learned to break tasks down, apply version control (git/GitHub), and deploy production-ready apps.
- **Career-Ready Skills**: Enhanced my resume, polished interview techniques, and built confidence through technical and soft-skill coaching.

I’m now fully geared up to contribute to meaningful MERN-stack projects and embrace collaboration with fellow developers. Eternally grateful to **Programming Hero** and the amazing Batch 08 community for this transformative journey.
